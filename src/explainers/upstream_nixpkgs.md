We don't recommend using forked or re-exported versions of Nixpkgs.
While this may be convenient in some cases, it can introduce unexpected behaviors and unwanted security risks.
While <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">upstream Nixpkgs</a> isn't bulletproof&mdash;nothing in software is!&mdash;it has a wide range of security measures in place, most notably continuous integration testing with <a href="https://hydra.nixos.org/">Hydra</a>, that mitigate a great deal of supply chain risk.
